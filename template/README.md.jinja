## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager

### Setup Development Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies and create virtual environment
uv sync --dev --all-extras

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Initialize development tools
./dev init
```

### Upgrading Dependencies
```bash
# Upgrade all dependencies to their latest allowed versions
./dev upgrade
```

This command runs `uv sync --upgrade --all-extras --dev` which will:
- Recreate the virtual environment
- Upgrade all dependencies (including extras and dev dependencies) to their latest allowed versions
- Update the lock file accordingly

### Running the Application
```bash
./dev run
```

### Code Formatting and Linting
```bash
./dev lint
```

### Testing
```bash
./dev test
```

### Building
```bash
./dev build
```

### Cleaning
```bash
# Clean build artifacts and cache directories
./dev clean
```

Removes:
- `dist/` directory (build artifacts)
- `.venv/` directory (virtual environment)
- `.local/` directory (local development files)
- `.pytest_cache/` directory (pytest cache)
- `.ruff_cache/` directory (ruff cache)
- `__pycache__/` directories (recursively)

### Running Claude Code with the virtual environment activated
```bash
./dev claude
```
